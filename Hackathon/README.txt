The files included:
train_modle.py - Module for evaluating different models and choosing the best
model for the assignment

regression.pkl - The trained mode for the linear regression to predict how
early or late the flight was

classifier.pkl - The trained mode for the classifier to predict the cause of
the delay

model.py - Module with FlightPredictor class that implement the predict(x)
function

weather_model.py - Module for processing the weather data so given a new
flight, we can determine what the weather was like when the flight departed and
arrived

multi_label_classification.py - Module for testing out and evaluating new multi
class modules that we didn't learn about in the course
